Privacy Policy for Paimon Bot by Araela

Last Update: 23:04 - 19/08/2023

This Privacy Policy describes how Paimon ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares personal information when you use our Discord bot and related services (the "Service").

Information We Collect:
- Discord User IDs: We collect Discord user IDs to provide the functionality of our bot, such as responding to commands and interactions.
- Server Information: We may collect information about the Discord servers where our bot is installed, including server IDs and stuff like that to enable server-specific features like the server settings.
- Command Data: We may collect and store data related to commands used within the bot for the purpose of improving our services and user experience.

How We Use Collected Information:
- To operate and maintain the Service, including responding to user commands and providing requested features.
- To improve and optimize the performance of the bot and enhance user experience.
- To analyze user behavior and preferences to better understand how the bot is being used.
- To communicate with users, respond to inquiries, and provide support.

Data Sharing and Disclosure:
- With Your Consent: We may share your information when you provide explicit consent for a specific purpose.
- Service Providers: We may engage third-party service providers to assist with the operation and maintenance of the Service. These providers will have access to your information solely for the purpose of performing tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
- Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request.

Security:
We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Your Choices:
You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information. To do so, you have some commands at your disposal on Paimon, you can also contact us to do so with your server data. If you need further assistance, you can contact us at araela@outlook.es for help with these requests.

Data Deletion upon Leaving a Server and Cancellation:

When you leave a server where our Discord bot is active, we want to provide clarity on how we handle your data within the bot environment.

Upon leaving a server, we retain your user data for a period of 7 to 14 days. This duration enables us to ensure the bot's smooth operation and address any potential issues. Following this period, your user data is permanently removed from our systems.

It's important to note that this data deletion process applies exclusively to the data collected by our bot during your interactions.

We also have an automatic cancellation. If you rejoin a server where the bot is active or add it to your own server, the data deletion stops. This means your user data stays in the bot.

If you have any inquiries regarding our data management practices, please don't hesitate to contact us at our contact email at the end of this Privacy Policy.

Data Deletion and Patreon Refunds:
Please note that in the event your data is deleted, we do not offer returns or refunds for Patreon membership (Like Paimon Plus memberships) fees. By becoming a Patreon supporter, you acknowledge and accept this policy.

Language Support for Emails:
We will only be answering emails in Spanish and English.

Changes to this Privacy Policy:
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any significant changes by posting the updated policy on Paimon's Trello or through the official Paimon updates channel.
